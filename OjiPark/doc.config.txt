Every model file can be accompanied with a .txt configuration file. 
This file is a simple tab delimited configuration.

First column is an object name to be modified. In order to apply changes to all files use special name 'default'.

Next columns are parameters, in no particular order.
Almost every option can be negated with - sign, f.i. select, becomes -select, etc.

select      - choose this object to be basis for instanciation
instance    - do not load data, create an instance of 'select' object
flat        - force object to be flat (only applies to fbx models)
smooth      - the same as -flat
delete      - delete this object
add         - the same as -delete
nflip       - flips all normals
notex       - disable textures
*.png       - define texture name
dshadow     - object will display shadow
cshadow     - object will cast shadow
parent      - choose this object to be animation parent
rotate      - define rotate animation; this has a special format: f.i.: rotate:x,ty,-1.0

NOT implemented:
nflip
